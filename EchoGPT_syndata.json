{"input": "The two-dimensional linear left ventricular ejection fraction was calculated at 25%. There is global hypokinesis with additional regional variation; please refer to the wall motion graphics for details. No intracardiac mass or thrombus is present; however, the left atrial appendage was not adequately visualized via transthoracic echocardiography to rule out a thrombus in this area. The estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is 32, with a systolic blood pressure of 120. There is a notable layer of anterior epicardial fat. The pulmonary valve was not clearly visualized. The Doppler flow pattern in the abdominal aorta is normal. The thickness of the left ventricular wall is normal. No atrial level shunt was detected by color flow imaging. The abdominal aorta was not completely visualized. The left ventricular strain assessment was not conducted due to poor image quality. The left atrial volume index is 28. There is no aortic valve regurgitation. There is mild mitral valve regurgitation. There is trivial pulmonary valve regurgitation. There is trivial tricuspid valve regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion. The aortic valve appears normal. The mitral valve is thickened. The tricuspid valve appears normal. The aortic valve has three leaflets. The left ventricular chamber is moderately to severely enlarged. The right ventricular chamber size is normal. The right atrial size is normal. The left atrial size is normal. The inferior vena cava shows normal inspiratory collapse (greater than 50%). The ascending aorta diameter is normal. The right ventricular systolic function is borderline reduced. The pulmonary valve systolic velocities are normal. The left ventricular diastolic function is indeterminate.", "output": "Global hypokinesis with superimposed regional variation is noted; please refer to the wall motion graphics for details. The estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is 32, with a systolic blood pressure of 120. There is no pericardial effusion and no significant valvular heart disease. The left ventricular chamber size is moderately to severely enlarged. The calculated ejection fraction is 25%. The right ventricular chamber size is normal, with a borderline decrease in systolic function. The inferior vena cava shows normal inspiratory collapse (greater than 50%). The size of the inferior vena cava is normal, and the left ventricular diastolic function is indeterminate."}
